## Regex Components

### Anchors

In regular expressions, we use anchors to check if the matching symbol is thestarting symbol or ending symbol of the input string. Anchors are of two types:The first type is the caret `^` that checks if the matching character is the firstcharacter of the input and the second type is the dollar sign `$` which checks if a matchingcharacter is the last character of the input string.

### Quantifiers

In regular expressions, quantifiers are used to specify the number of times that a character or a group of characters can be repated. For example, the regular expression `[0-9]{2-3}` means: Match at least 2 digits, but not more than 3, ranging from 0 to 9.
